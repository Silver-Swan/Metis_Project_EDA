- For this graph I narrowed down the SQL dataframe using SQLite, then with pandas, refined that dataframe further by grouping stations with the most entries.

- Then with that dataset I used matplotlib to create this bar chart.

- This graph depicts the top 5 used train staions from June 2021 to August 2021.

- Higher the number of entries indicate the number of people using these turnstiles.

- These would be the most ideal locations to place WomenTechWomenYes street teams.

- With a significant difference in use as compared to the others, there is an increase in chance of gathering the most emails.

- As well as, verifying that the emails collected would be from local people that can attend meetups and other social events held by the company. 

- During the pandemic, these turnstiles were still being used for people coming and going into Jersey City.

![The Amount of Passengers entering at 34 ST and Harold SQ over the span of 3 months](https://github.com/Silver-Swan/WomanTechWomen-Project/blob/master/WTWY%20Project/images1/Number%20of%20passangers%20entering%20at%2034%20ST%20and%20Harold%20SQ%20station%20in%20the%20span%20of%203%20months.png)

- For this graph, with the refined dataset from above, used pandas the sort this specific station by time with an interval of 4 hours.

- I used matplotlib again to create this line chart to show the change in the span of 20 hours. Over the span of 3 months going from June 2021 to August 2021

- The data used for the graph was the number of people entering the tunrstile at 34 ST and Harold SQ station. 

- The graph illustrates that the optimal time to place the street teams are between 4 pm and 8 pm at the turnstiles on 34 ST and Harold SQ. 

- The information this graph shows that from midnight to noon, there is a steady increase of people using this stations entrance.

- There is a fair chance that the people using this turnstile is going to be a mixture of local New Yorkers and tourist, but at this time frame that likelihood drops.
