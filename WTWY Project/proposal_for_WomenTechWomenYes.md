# Effective Locations and Times for Collecting Emails

*Questions/Needed*
<br>
The initial plan is to present what subway station and time or times of day are going to be optimal for gathering people's info to support WomenTechWomenYes. Considering the time or times of day with the most amount of people will help prioritize the placement of their street team.

Data Description
The turnstile data gathered from the MTA database will be used to determine the most usage. The sample will be 3-4 months of every Saturday with the number entered and exited. The time of day and which streets will also be accounted into the data. This information will help narrow down the location of the street team's placement.

Tools
I will use Pandas to organize and clean the data pulled from the MTA SQL database. I will categorize by busiest station and the time of day with the highest frequency.  Then using matplotlib to create a graph.

MVP Goal
The goal will be showing the stations with the highest frequency of passengers relative to the time the of day. This will further show where the street teams will be placed.
