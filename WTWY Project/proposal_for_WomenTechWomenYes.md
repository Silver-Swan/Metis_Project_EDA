# Effective Locations and Time for Collecting Emails

The initial plan is to present what subway station and time or times of day are going to be optimal for gathering people's info to support WomenTechWomenYes.

The turnstile data gathered from the MTA will be analyzed to determine the most usage. The sample will be a 3-4 months of every Saturday with the number entered and exited. Time of day and which streets will also be accounted into the data. This information will help narrow down the location of the street team's placement. The prediction is the best location will be in the evening at Penn Station on 34th street and Chambers St between Warren and Murray. A more accurate detail will follow upon further analysis.

I will use a DB Browser to organize the data gathered from the MTA in a way that will show the number of people using them. As well as the time of day with the highest frequency.  Then using Jupyter notebook to along with matplotlib create a graph showing the highest frequency of passengers relative to the time the of day with the highest people using them.
