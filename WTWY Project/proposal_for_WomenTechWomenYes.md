# Effective Locations and Time for Collecting Emails

The inital plan is to present what subway station and time are going to be optimal for gathering people's info to support WomenTechWomenYes.

The turnstil data gathered from the MTA will be analyze to determine the optimal location to place the street teams. The sample will be a month of every Saturday the number entered and exited.(features - time of day, location of the subway enterance or exit)(characteristics - passangers entering the station or leaving the station)Time of day and which streets has the highest frequecy of passangers. This information will help narrow down the location of the street team's placement. The prediction is the best location will be in the afternoon at Penn Station on 34th street and Chambers St between Warren and Murray. A more accurate detail will follow upon further analysis

I will use a DB Browser to catogorize the data gathered from the MTA and Jupyter notebook to along with matplotlib create a graph showing where and what time has the highest frequecy of passangers.
