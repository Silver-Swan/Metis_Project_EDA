This Repo is the home to the first project done with Metis. This project focused on using New York City turnstile data from the MTA. The target for this project was a made up group called WomenTechWomenYes where I was tasked with finding the optimal placement for their street team to collect information from pedestrians. Their focus group were people based locally and interested in supporting the cause of women in the tech industry.
